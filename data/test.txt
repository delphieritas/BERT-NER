offer O
an O
opportunity O
to O
reflect O
on O
how O

To O
do O

back O

from O
what O
Steve B-PER
Jobs I-PER
did O
when O
he O
recruited O
Ive B-PER
as O
his O
co-pilot O
for O
Apple B-ORG
's O
innovation O
journey O
. O

In O
1997 O
, O
Jobs O
had O
just O
returned O
to O
Apple B-ORG
and O
needed O
to O
reinvigorate O
the O
innovative O
soul O
of O
the O
organization O
. O

He O
wanted O
design O
to O
be O
at O
the O
core O
of O
this O
renewal O
. O

Since O
Apple B-ORG
was O
a O
computer O
company O
at O
that O
time O
, O
you O
would O
have O
expected O
Jobs O
would O
have O
searched O
for O
an O
expert O
computer O
designer O
-- O
someone O
well-respected O
in O
the O
industry O
. O

He O
did O
not O
. O

Before O
joining O
Apple B-ORG
, O
Ive B-PER
had O
been O
an O
independent O
design O
consultant O
in O
London B-LOC
. O

His O
firm O
, O
Tangerine B-PER
, O
was O
involved O
in O
designing O
household O
products O
-LRB- O
for O
example O
, O
Tangerine B-PER
was O
a O
consultant O
for O
Ideal B-ORG
Standard I-ORG
, O
then O
a O
major O
player O
in O
the O
bathroom O
and O
plumbing O
industry O
-RRB- O
. O

The O
young O
designer O
then O
moved O
to O
Apple B-ORG
in O
1992 O
, O
but O
the O
designs O
he O
was O
involved O
in O
prior O
to O
1997 O
were O
not O
especially O
successful O
. O

So O
, O
Jobs O
's O
decision O
to O
pick O
him O
to O
be O
the O
senior O
vice O
president O
of O
industrial O
design O
seemed O
irrational O
. O

Yet O
, O
in O
hindsight O
it O
was O
a O
brilliant O
choice O
. O

The O
lesson O
: O
When O
choosing O
an O
innovator O
, O
look O
to O
the O
future O
, O
not O
the O
past O
. O

Before O
1997 O
personal O
computers O
were O
mainly O
office O
machines O
. O

But O
the O
advent O
of O
the O
internet O
ushered O
in O
a O
new O
era O
: O
Computers O
were O
fast O
becoming O
a O
fixture O
in O
homes O
; O
people O
therefore O
would O
need O
a O
machine O
that O
would O
fit O
into O
their O
living O
rooms O
or O
kitchens O
. O

If O
Jobs O
had O
looked O
to O
the O
past O
, O
he O
would O
have O
searched O
for O
an O
expert O
designer O
of O
office O
computers O
, O
possibly O
a O
successful O
one O
. O

That O
choice O
, O
however O
, O
would O
have O
led O
to O
the O
creation O
of O
another O
perfect O
, O
beige O
box O
. O

Jobs O
instead O
looked O
to O
the O
future O
: O
If O
computers O
would O
become O
home O
machines O
, O
then O
recruiting O
someone O
who O
had O
designed O
products O
for O
the O
homes O
would O
n't O
be O
such O
a O
crazy O
idea O
. O

The O
first O
product O
designed O
under O
Ive B-PER
's O
leadership O
was O
the O
iMac O
G3 O
, O
introduced O
in O
1998 O
. O

It O
was O
acclaimed O
as O
one O
of O
the O
most O
revolutionary O
personal O
computers O
ever O
released O
, O
with O
a O
design O
language O
that O
was O
completely O
novel O
for O
the O
industry O
: O
a O
friendly O
shell O
in O
translucent O
colored O
plastic O
and O
an O
ovoid O
form O
that O
challenged O
the O
dominant O
paradigm O
of O
unsympathetic O
beige O
boxes O
. O

The O
same O
translucent O
plastic O
and O
colors O
had O
already O
spread O
into O
household O
products O
in O
the O
early O
1990s O
-LRB- O
an O
example O
was O
Alessi B-PER
's O
colorful O
plastic O
kitchenware O
-RRB- O
. O

One O
takeaway O
: O
When O
you O
are O
picking O
talent O
for O
innovation O
endeavors O
, O
you O
should O
imagine O
what O
is O
coming O
down O
the O
pike O
-- O
what O
the O
future O
will O
look O
like O
-- O
and O
then O
understand O
which O
capabilities O
you O
will O
need O
to O
succeed O
in O
that O
future O
. O

Unless O
you O
do O
this O
first O
, O
you O
can O
not O
hope O
to O
find O
and O
attract O
the O
right O
person O
. O

If O
Tim B-PER
Cook I-PER
has O
absorbed O
Steve B-PER
Jobs I-PER
's O
lesson O
, O
his O
choice O

successor O

assets O
after O

handful O
of O
professional O
matches O
, O
early O
signs O
suggest O
that O
Ms B-PER
Gauff I-PER
is O
unusually O
mature O
for O
her O
age O
. O

Her O
match O
against O
Ms B-PER
Williams I-PER
took O
place O
on O
the O
biggest O
stage O
of O
her O
career O
, O
against O
a O
legendary O
opponent O
. O

â€œ O
I O
have O
never O
played O
on O
a O
court O
so O
big O
, O
but O
I O
had O
to O
remind O
myself O
that O
the O
lines O
on O
the O
court O
are O
the O
same O
size O
, O
â€ O
she O
later O
declared O
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
she O
seemed O
unperturbed O
by O
the O
sorts O
of O
hiccups O
that O
often O
derail O
young O
players O
. O

In O
the O
final O
set O
, O
she O
had O
to O
overcome O
two O
particularly O
severe O
hiccups O
. O

After O
double-faulting O
on O
the O
fifth O
and O
sixth O
points O
of O
her O
first O
service O
game O
, O
she O
immediately O
bounced O
back O
, O
winning O
two O
points O
with O
a O
protracted O
rally O
and O
a O
strong O
first O
serve O
, O
to O
secure O
the O
game O
. O

In O
the O
eighth O
game O
of O
the O
set O
, O
she O
double-faulted O
twice O
more O
, O
surrendering O
a O
one-break O
advantage O

falling O
to O
Apr-04 O
in O
the O
second O
set O

But O
again O
, O
she O
held O
her O
nerve O
and O
regained O
the O
break O
in O
the O
following O
game O
. O

The O
immediate O
challenge O
facing O
Ms B-PER
Gauff I-PER
is O
to O
sustain O
her O
level O

play O

In O
the O
second O
round O

she O
will O

an O
unseeded O
Slovakian B-MISC
known O
for O
her O
grass-court O

If O
Ms B-PER
Gauff I-PER
advances O
further O

her O

third-round O

big-hitting O
Ms B-PER

force O
Ms B-PER

to O
confront O
an O
opponent O
much O
like O

only O
even O

powerful O

one O

the O
unheralded O

prove O
an O
even O

One O
of O
the O
reasons O
why O
the O
problem O

so O
awkward O
for O

that O

more O
devoutly O

these O

it O
is O
racing O

imitate O

even O
outdo O
the O
Gallic B-MISC

embrace O

but O
just O
have O
always O
had O
the O
kind O
of O
body O
that O
hangs O
onto O
a O
probably O
fine O
amount O
of O
fat O
In O
my O
early O
20s O
, O
I O
had O
worked O
service O
jobs O
or O
physical O
labor O
, O
spending O
the O
day O
on O
my O
feet O
and O
often O
exercising O
before O
or O
after O
. O

But O
once O
I O
found O
myself O
sitting O
behind O
an O
aging O
computer O
in O
a O
magazine O
office O
in O
Washington B-LOC
, O
I O
started O
to O
gain O
weight O
, O
slowly O
, O
but O
inescapably O
. O

The O
delicate O
balance O
of O
appreciation O
and O
loathing O
I O
felt O
for O
my O
body O
tipped O
â€” O
I O
felt O
it O
was O
betraying O
me O
and O
spiraling O
out O
of O
control O
. O

And O
so O
I O
searched O
for O
a O
ways O
to O
wrestle O
it O
back O
into O
line O
. O

I O
ran O
more O
and O
did O
hot O
yoga O
. O

I O
heaved O
a O
filing O
cabinet O
onto O
a O
table O
and O
fashioned O
myself O
a O
sort O
of O
brutalist O
standing O
desk O
. O

But O
the O
problem O
, O
I O
eventually O
realized O
, O
was O
my O
relationship O
to O
food O
, O
always O
stressed O
, O
I O
chased O
down O
my O
salads O
with O
any O
carbohydrate O
not O
nailed O
down O
. O

Eating O
raw O
or O
straight-up O
fasting O
were O
ways O
to O
regain O
a O
modicum O
of O
control O
over O
my O
appetites O
, O
at O
least O
at O
first O
, O
and O
to O
do O
so O
in O
ways O
that O
felt O
like O
fun O
, O
slightly O
absurd O
challenges O
: O
There O
's O
a O
machismo O
to O
this O
sort O
of O
explicit O
bodily O
abuse O
that O
simple O
healthy O
living O
doesn O
't O
offer O
. O

But O
if O
this O
started O
out O
about O
weight O
, O
at O
some O
point O
, O
for O
me O
, O
these O
obsessions O
stopped O
being O
about O
my O
body O
; O
the O
strain O
of O
a O
new O
fitness O
regimen O
, O
a O
new O
mania O
, O
be O
it O
lifting O
or O
raw O
food O
, O
became O
its O
own O
draw O
It O
's O
clear O
I O
'm O
not O
the O
only O
one O
, O
and O
not O
the O
only O
guy O
â O
who O
sees O
something O
appealing O
here O
. O

If O
fasting O
started O
as O
a O
life O
hack O
for O
the O
billionaire O
class O
, O
which O
in O
turn O
saw O
would-be O

follow O

if O

We O
live O
in O
a O
time O
of O
wellness O
not O
as O
health O
but O
as O
transcendence O
. O

It O
's O
not O
a O
coincidence O
that O
all O
of O
the O
supposed O
cures O
of O
wellness-adjacent O
diet O
hacking O
hinge O
on O
extreme O
behavior O
, O
fasting O
, O
or O
that O
daily O
coffee O
you O
put O
special O
butter O
in O
. O

The O
appeal O
of O
this O
brand O
of O
wellness O
has O
very O
little O
to O
do O
with O
being O
healthy O
. O

After O
all O
, O
most O
of O
what O
maintaining O
good O
health O
requires O
feels O
pretty O
good O
: O
eat O
well O
, O
exercise O
, O
get O
enough O
sleep O
, O
practice O
everything O
in O
moderation O
( O
even O
moderation O
) O
, O
etc. O

With O
â€œ O
biohacking O
, O

the O
effects O
are O
ephemeral O
and O
the O
health O
claims O
are O
dubious O
. O

But O
what O
these O
crude O
approaches O
do O
offer O
is O
a O
sense O
of O
control O
in O
the O
moment O
, O
a O
way O
to O
tell O
yourself O
that O
you O
are O
willing O
some O
change O
into O
being O
. O

It O
would O
perhaps O
be O
going O
too O
far O
to O
call O
this O
kind O
of O
behavior O
an O
â€œ O
eating O
disorder O

; O
those O
are O
conditions O
that O
send O
people O
to O
the O
hospital O
and O
sometimes O
kill O
them O
, O
not O
a O
series O
of O
passing O
, O
momentary O
manias O
. O

But O
nor O
do O
I O
have O
a O
healthy O
relationship O
with O
food O
or O
exercise O
, O
a O
fact O
about O
my O
life O
that O
up O
until O
recently O
has O
been O
more O
or O
less O
obscured O
by O
my O
gender O
. O

After O
all O
, O
if O
I O
asked O
you O
to O
picture O
someone O
grappling O
with O
disordered O
eating O
, O
would O
you O
imagine O
a O
skinny O
teenage O
girl O
or O
me O
a O
33-year-old O
man O
who O
weighs O
200 O
pounds O
and O
is O
flirting O
with O
exercise O
bulimia O
? O
I O
bet O
you O
a O
cookie O
you O
picked O
the O
former O
. O

So O
if O
there O
's O
an O
upside O
to O
the O
male-driven O
starvation-as-biohacking O
era O
, O
it O
might O
be O
that O
it O
reveals O
what O
disordered O
eating O
and O
exercising O
, O
stripped O
of O
their O
typical O
gender O
norms O
, O
are O
actually O
about O
. O

We O
typically O
tend O
to O
think O
of O
these O
behaviors O
as O
feminine O
ones O
. O

As O
a O
result O
, O
there O
's O
often O
an O
impression O
that O
they O
are O
primarily O
about O
appearance O
and O
, O
sometimes O
, O
vanity O
. O

They O
can O
be O
, O
but O
this O
, O
of O
course O
, O
was O
never O
the O
whole O
story O
. O

Today O
's O
eating O
disorder O
is O
as O
likely O
to O
come O
in O
the O
guise O
of O
a O
diet O
that O
purports O
to O
optimize O
you O
to O
survive O
and O
thrive O
in O
late O
capitalism O
as O
it O
is O
one O
that O
claims O
to O
make O
you O
beach-body O
ready O
. O

What O
these O
iterations O
reveal O
is O
how O
much O
more O
disordered O
obsessive O
behavior O
around O
food O
and O
exercise O
can O
be O
about O
, O
how O
many O
kinds O
of O
feelings O
this O
sort O
of O
behavior O
can O
become O
a O
vessel O
for O
. O

In O
an O
era O
when O
so O
many O
of O
us O
feel O
the O
world O
spiraling O
out O
of O
control O
, O
maybe O
it O
's O
just O
the O
promise O
of O
being O
able O
to O
control O
something O
, O
to O
will O
a O
change O
, O
any O
change O
, O
into O
being O
, O
that O
's O
the O
draw O
. O

A O
few O
days O
ago O
, O
as O
I O
was O
thinking O
about O
writing O
this O
, O
I O
sat O
down O
in O
front O
of O
my O
computer O
and O
took O
a O
questionnaire O
from O
the O
National B-ORG
Eating I-ORG
Disorder I-ORG
Association I-ORG
to O
see O
whether O
I O
was O
at O
risk O
. O

I O
clicked O
through O
the O
questions O
, O
yes O
, O
I O
had O
gone O
to O
extremes O
to O
exercise O
after O
eating O
; O
no O
, O
I O
don O
't O
tend O
to O
hide O
when O
I O
eat O
out O
of O
shame O
. O

At O
the O
end O
of O
it O
, O
the O
website O
told O
me O
I O
was O
at O
risk O
and O
should O
probably O
talk O
to O
someone O
When O
I O
mentioned O
those O
results O
to O
two O
close O
female O
acquaintances O
, O
both O
of O
them O
laughed O
before O
catching O
themselves O
, O
horrified O
. O

Both O
, O
for O
the O
record O
, O
are O
thoughtful O
, O
sensitive O
women who O
don O
't O
cop O
to O
gender O
stereotypes O
. O

They O
were O
both O
familiar O
with O
my O
history O
of O
fixation O
with O
wellness O
fads O
. O

Maybe O
it O
was O
just O
the O
moment O
of O
that O
absurd O
history O
suddenly O
being O
recast O
with O
a O
new O
, O
worrisome O
weight O

I O
laughed O

too O
, O
for O
what O
it O
's O
worth O

fighting O
in O
the O
Korean B-MISC

. O

The O
encounter O
in O
Panmunjom B-LOC
had O
been O
cast O
as O
a O
brief O
handshake O
, O
not O
a O
formal O
negotiation O
, O
but O
the O
two O
ended O
up O
together O
for O
a O
little O
more O
than O
an O
hour O
. O

After O
emerging O
from O
their O
conversation O
, O
Mr. B-PER
Trump I-PER
said O
he O
and O
Mr. B-PER
Kim I-PER
had O
agreed O
to O
designate O
negotiators O
to O
resume O
talks O
in O
the O
next O
few O
weeks O
, O
four O
months O
after O
they O
collapsed O
at O
a O
summit O
meeting O
in O
Hanoi B-LOC
, O
Vietnam B-LOC
. O

The O
American B-MISC
team O
will O
still O
be O
headed O
by O
Stephen B-PER
Biegun I-PER
, O
the O
special O
envoy O
, O
but O
it O
remained O
unclear O
who O
would O
be O
on O
the O
North B-MISC
Korean I-MISC
side O
after O
reports O
of O
a O
purge O
of O
Mr. B-PER
Kim I-PER
’s O
team O
. O

Asked O
later O
if O
North B-MISC
Korean I-MISC
negotiators O
were O
still O
alive O
, O
Mr. B-PER
Trump I-PER
said O
: O
“ O
I O
think O
they O
are O
. O

I O
can O
tell O
you O
who O
the O
main O
person O
is O
. O

And O
I O
would O
hope O
the O
rest O
are O
, O
too O
. O

” O
Mr. B-PER
Trump I-PER
was O
already O
scheduled O
to O
make O
an O
unannounced O
visit O
to O
the O
DMZ B-MISC
during O
his O
trip O
to O
South B-LOC
Korea I-LOC
, O
and O
he O
portrayed O
the O
idea O
of O
meeting O
Mr. B-PER
Kim I-PER
as O
a O
spontaneous O
one O
, O
although O
he O
had O
been O
musing O
out O
loud O
about O
it O
for O
days O
. O

Still O
, O
it O
caught O
even O
his O
own O
staff O
by O
surprise O
and O
forced O
an O
extraordinary O
scramble O
to O
arrange O
logistics O
and O
security O
, O
a O
task O
that O
would O
ordinarily O
take O
days O
or O
weeks O
. O

Mr. B-PER
Trump I-PER
gambled O
that O
the O
show O
of O
amity O
could O
crack O
the O
nuclear O
logjam O
, O
underscoring O
his O
faith O
in O
the O
power O
of O
his O
own O
personal O
diplomacy O
— O
even O
with O
brutal O
strongmen O
like O
Mr. B-PER
Kim I-PER
— O
to O
achieve O
what O
past O
presidents O
could O
not O
. O

More O
than O
halfway O
through O
his O
term O
, O
Mr. B-PER
Trump I-PER
is O
eager O
for O
a O
resolution O
to O
the O
longstanding O
dispute O
, O
seeing O
it O
as O
a O
signature O
element O
of O
the O
legacy O
he O
hopes O
to O
forge O
and O
a O
potential O
boost O
to O
his O
re-election O
campaign O
. O

Even O
in O
this O
symbolic O
moment O
of O
reconciliation O
, O
Mr. B-PER
Trump I-PER
seemed O
to O
toggle O
back O
and O
forth O
between O
glory O
and O
grievance O
, O
reveling O
one O
minute O
in O
the O
history O
of O
the O
day O
and O
then O
the O
next O
griping O
that O
he O
was O
not O
getting O
enough O
credit O
for O
reducing O
friction O
with O
North B-LOC
Korea I-LOC
. O

He O
seemed O
acutely O
defensive O
about O
criticism O
that O
he O
has O
yet O
to O
reach O
an O
agreement O
to O
eliminate O
North B-LOC

June O
2018 O

in O

in O

. O

Almost O
every O
time O
he O
saw O
a O

, O
he O
complained O
that O
his O
